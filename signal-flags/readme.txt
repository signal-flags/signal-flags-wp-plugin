Display flags from the International Code of Signals (ICS), the Racing Rules of
Sailing (RRS) and other nautical flags on your website.

== Description ==

To insert an image of the flag for Letter A in a post or page, use the shortcode
`[signal-flag a]`. You can use the following flags with the corresponding codes:
- Alphabet flags A-Z (codes `a`-`z`)
- Numeral pennants 0-9 (codes `n0` - `n9`)
- Answering pennant (AP) (code `ap`)
- 1st, 2nd and 3rd substitute (codes `s1`-`s3`)
- Various flags defined in the Racing Rules of Sailing (codes `black`,
  `blackwhite`, `blue`, `green`, `greenwhite`, `red`, `yellow`)

Images are embedded in the page using the SVG vector format (much quicker than
loading a separate image file) and eight sets of flag images are included with
the following options:
- with or without outlines for ease of use on white backgrounds (including when
  printed)
- 4x3 and square shapes for letter flags
- in 'natural' or 'primary' colours.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't these flags look like the ones we use at our club? =

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) publishes standard designs, but
there are many variations in the shapes of flags in use around the world.
This plugin provides letter flags in square and 4:3 aspect ratios, but all the
pennants are 2:1 and the triangle flags 4:3.

= Can I change the colours? =

This plugin provides flags in two different colour schemes:
'natural' which aim to look like real flags
'primary' which uses primary colours as often used for these flags.

We are working on an option to customise the colours.
